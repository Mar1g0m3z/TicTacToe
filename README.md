# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React. Play against a friend and enjoy the classic gameplay.

## Features

- Play against a friend in a 2-player mode.
- Dynamic board that updates with player moves.
- Indicates the winner or a draw at the end of the game.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements:
Feature 1: AI Player To implement this feature, you can create an AI player that can play against the human player. You can use algorithms like the Minimax algorithm to determine the best moves for the AI player. Implement a function that generates AI moves and updates the board accordingly.

Feature 2: Game Modes Implement different game modes to add variety to the gameplay. For example, you can introduce a "Two-Player" mode where two human players can compete against each other. You can also add a "Single-Player" mode where the player can choose to play against the AI. Create a user interface to allow the player to select the desired game mode and adjust the game logic accordingly.
